# Journal-Entries-Project
###### The goal of this side project is to build a blog system where users can write entries and read through them later in following way: 
1. Sort by date
2. Sort by title alphabetically
3. Sort by ascribed tags

###### This project will be using database commands and more front end exposure.
######Also might some light hearted fun with css and styling. Potentially will try Sass
